<h1>My Favorite Places to Travel</h1>

	<p> My favorite places that I have visited over the years are Ludington, Michigan,
	Branson, Missouri, and Houston, Texas. I also had a great trip to Detroit, Michigan
	for a Lions game in 2015. Not to mention, I am excited to visit New York City and 
	Dallas over the next couple summers.</p>
